# Changelog

All notable changes to The Emerald Standard are documented here.

## 0.2.0-alpha.1 - 2026-09-01

### Added

- A full graphical Banker dashboard with Overview, Market, Banking, and Exchange pages.
- Interactive 180-day market charts backed by persistent price history.
- One-click amount presets for 1, 5, 10, 32, 64, or all available units.
- GUI-based deposits, withdrawals, savings transfers, investment purchases and sales, CDs, villager lending, resource exchange, and transaction recovery.
- Automatic Village Bank and Exchange buildings generated on safe plots near discovered villages.
- Persistent Banker villagers placed inside generated banks.
- Natural village fallback that designates an adult village resident as Banker when no safe bank plot is available.
- Persistent generated-bank region tracking to prevent repeated structures in the same village area.
- Fabric and NeoForge client screen registration.
- English interface translations.
- Regression tests for mixed online and offline clocks, checksum recovery, future-format handling, chart history, and generated-bank persistence.

### Changed

- Moved normal player interaction from commands to right-clicking Banker villagers.
- Restricted the complete `/emerald` command tree to permission level 2 for administrators and diagnostics.
- Bumped Fabric and NeoForge versions to `0.2.0-alpha.1`.
- Bumped the persistent data format from 3 to 4.
- Replaced separate wall-clock and game-tick remainders with one unified economic-time accumulator.
- Extended market snapshots with bounded chart history.
- Updated Fabric and NeoForge source sets to include shared client code and shared resources.

### Fixed

- Prevented overlapping wall-clock and game-tick progress from double-counting economic time.
- Prevented empty or truncated current saves from being accepted as fresh worlds.
- Added SHA-256 save checksums so silent balance and history corruption is detected.
- Prevented a future-format primary save from silently falling back to and overwriting an older backup.
- Preserved valid legacy format 1, format 2, and format 3 migrations.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Preserved partial Minecraft-day and wall-clock progress across short sessions and restarts.
- Prevented very large offline gaps from blocking server startup with an unbounded single-thread catch-up loop.
- Added crash-recoverable coordination between the separate bank save and Minecraft player inventory save.
- Rejected save files created by a newer unsupported data format instead of interpreting them as current data.
- Added stronger validation for active and inactive CDs, villager loans, holdings, and pending inventory transactions.
- Corrected short-term villager lending economics so 30-day and 90-day terms offer a meaningful expected premium over savings.
- Prevented failed automatic saves from retrying every server tick.
- Prevented unbounded command amounts from creating excessive inventory loops or overflow risk.

### Changed

- Bumped the persistent data format from 2 to 3.
- Bumped Fabric and NeoForge versions to `0.1.0-alpha.2`.
- Replaced routine per-day synchronous saves with 30-second save batching while keeping account mutations durable.
- Added exponential automatic-save retry backoff from 2 seconds to 60 seconds.
- Limited trusted startup catch-up to 25,000 economic days and processed it in bounded startup and tick batches.
- Paused banking while catch-up remains so players cannot trade against an economy that has not reached the current day.
- Switched deterministic transcendental calculations to `StrictMath` for more consistent cross-platform replay.
- Pinned Fabric Loom to `1.17.20` instead of a snapshot plugin.
- Required Fabric API `0.158.0+26.2` or newer in metadata.
- Changed command errors to Brigadier failures and added ticker, term, and resource suggestions.
- Added lightweight market and portfolio snapshots so ordinary reads no longer clone every account.
- Updated CI to launch Fabric and NeoForge dedicated-server development environments after successful builds.
- Used vanilla's public online-player data flush before clearing completed inventory journals because the single-player save method is protected.

### Added

- Durable `PREPARED` and `BANK_COMMITTED` inventory transaction journal stages.
- Automatic transaction reconciliation on Fabric and NeoForge player login and logout.
- `/emerald recover` for manual reconciliation.
- Synchronous online-player data flushes before a completed inventory transaction journal is cleared.
- Tests for partial-day restarts, bounded catch-up, catch-up transaction blocking, inventory journals, future-format rejection, trading friction, save retry backoff, and term-by-term villager lending economics.
- Dedicated transaction-recovery documentation.
- Dedicated-server smoke-test script and CI log artifacts.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 - 2026-08-31

- Rebuilt and calibrated the deterministic market model.
- Added locked-rate CDs, risky player-funded villager lending, dynamic commodities, private economy seeds, atomic saves, backup recovery, migration, and dual-loader builds.

## 0.0.1-prototype - 2026-08-31

- Initial public architecture prototype for Minecraft 26.2.
